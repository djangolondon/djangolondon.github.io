- title: Datasette
  speaker: Simon Willison
  description: Datasette is an open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data. It sits at the centre of a growing ecosystem of tools and plugins aimed at converting all kinds of sources of data into SQLite databases, then making it as easy as possible to publish those databases online, explore their contents and convert them into other useful formats.<br>I'll show how to use Datasette and demonstrate a number of interesting use-cases - from exploring Covid-19 data to personal analytics using data from Twitter, GitHub and Apple Health.
